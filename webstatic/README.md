## Adding Bootstrap
In addition to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using Bootstrap can also be a helpful way to create an e-commerce website. Bootstrap is a front-end framework that provides pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components that can be used to create responsive, mobile-first websites.

Some of the things you might learn by using Bootstrap to create an e-commerce website include:

- Responsive design: Bootstrap is designed to be responsive, which means that it adjusts the layout and styling of a website to provide an optimal viewing experience on a wide range of devices, from small smartphones to large desktop monitors. By using Bootstrap, you can learn how to create websites that look and function well on different devices and screen sizes.

- Pre-designed components: Bootstrap includes a wide range of pre-designed components, such as buttons, forms, navbars, and grids, that can be easily added to your website using HTML and CSS classes. By using these components, you can save time and effort in creating the layout and styling of your website.

- JavaScript plugins: Bootstrap also includes a number of JavaScript plugins that can be used to add interactive features to your website, such as modals, tabs, and carousels. By using these plugins, you can add interactive elements to your website without having to write custom JavaScript code.

Overall, using Bootstrap can be a helpful way to create an e-commerce website by providing pre-designed components and tools that can save time and effort in the development process.
